# infrared-spectrum-reinterpretation

This project is a tool for reinterpret, transcode infrared analysis of various molecules into different medium:
- light sequences
- sounds
- motion keys

Infrared spectrum come from NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology - U.S. Department of Commerce),
due to a server limitation we have to download files manually from [nist.gov](http://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/name-ser/)
and put into this script.

This project is produced within the framework of a part of the COSA research group, which studies relation between art and science.
